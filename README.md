# `giro`

Giro is a productivity tool for neurodivergent people.

It sets boundaries for you, and helps you to keep track of your time.

## Contributing

The project is too young to have a contributing guide or to accept contributions.

You can still talk to me [here](https://discord.gg/gNG8fsg4DD).

Also, this is one of the worst codebases I have ever written because I'm trying to move fast and pay the cost later.
Please don't use patterns you see here anywhere.
